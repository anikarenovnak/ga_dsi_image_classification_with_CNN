# Doodle Images Classification with a Convolutional Neural Network: Methods for Looking Under the Hood of the Model 

This is my capstone project for General Assembly's Data Science Immersive program. 


## Problem Statement

I will build an image classification model which uses a convolutional neural network to classify images into their respective 5 categories. The purpose of this project is to use this model to demonstrate how some approaches can be applied to help us understand what goes on inside the black box of a neural network. Such understanding can provide valuable insights into
1. the limitations of the model in general
2. where and why the model may fail to correctly predict classes of images
